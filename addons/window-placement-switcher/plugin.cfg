name="Window Placement Switcher"
description="A dropdown button in your toolbar that lets you switch directly between screens/monitors to run your project on.
How it works: It reads & sets the editor setting \"run/window_placement/screen\" and generates its options directly from the corresponding hint_string, attempting to stay up-to-date with possible future changes."
