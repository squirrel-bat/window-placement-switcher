# window-placement-switcher
A dropdown button in your toolbar that lets you switch directly between screens/monitors to run your project on.

## How does it work?
It reads & sets the editor setting `run/window_placement/screen` and generates its options directly from the corresponding `hint_string`, attempting to stay up-to-date with possible future changes.
